The Grafton website, while offering a clear and well-indexed experience for AI agents, faces critical challenges in fundamental areas of web presence. The complete absence of HTTPS is a severe trust and security issue that must be addressed immediately. Accessibility also requires significant improvement to comply with basic standards and the upcoming European Accessibility Act. UX/Performance is average, with opportunities for optimization, but it's secondary to the critical security and accessibility concerns. The strong Agent Readiness score indicates the site is discoverable by search engines, but the core issues could deter users once they arrive.

Top 5 Impact Fixes
1
Implement HTTPS (SSL/TLS Certificate)
The most critical issue is the lack of HTTPS encryption. This exposes user data and significantly erodes trust. Implementing an SSL certificate is paramount for security and credibility.

Impact: High
Effort: Medium
Pillar: trust
2
Ensure all Links and Interactive Elements Have Accessible Names
Many interactive elements lack accessible names, making them unusable for screen reader users. This is a fundamental accessibility barrier and a critical EAA compliance issue.

Impact: High
Effort: Low
Pillar: accessibility
3
Implement Semantic Landmark Roles and a 'Skip to Content' Link
Adding proper landmark roles and a 'skip to content' link drastically improves navigation for keyboard and screen reader users, addressing significant accessibility and EAA compliance points.

Impact: High
Effort: Low
Pillar: accessibility
4
Add a Comprehensive Privacy Policy and Cookie Consent
Legally required for EU websites, a clear Privacy Policy and Cookie Consent mechanism are crucial for building user trust and avoiding regulatory penalties.

Impact: High
Effort: Medium
Pillar: trust
5
Optimize Images for Web Delivery
Optimizing images by compressing them and serving them in appropriate sizes and modern formats will significantly reduce page load times and improve the overall user experience.

Impact: Medium
Effort: Medium
Pillar: uxPerf
