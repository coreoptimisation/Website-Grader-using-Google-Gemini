Of course. Here is a comprehensive technical brief for your developer, packaging the identification methodologies we've discussed into an actionable plan.

Technical Brief: Enhancing the Booking Engine Identification System

Objective: To accurately identify the third-party booking engine or e-commerce platform used on a given hotel or visitor attraction website. This document outlines a multi-layered, waterfall-based approach for analysis, moving from simple, high-confidence checks to more complex source code introspection.

Core Strategy

The system should process a target URL (ideally the first page of the booking process) through a sequence of identification methods. If a high-confidence match is found at any step, the process concludes and logs the result. If not, it proceeds to the next, more intensive method.

Identification Methodologies (In Order of Implementation)
Method 1: Direct Footer/Branding Analysis (High Confidence, Low Cost)

This is the most common and reliable method. Many providers include an explicit link or text in the page footer.

Action:

Fetch the HTML content of the booking page.

Use a DOM parser to select the <footer> element.

Scan all <a> tags and plain text within the footer for keywords like:

"Booking Engine by"

"Powered by"

"Hotel Software"

If a keyword is found, extract the provider's name from the associated text or link.

Example (The Grafton Hotel):

The code contained: <a ... href="https://www.p3hotels.com/">Booking Engine by P3 Hotel Software</a>

Result: P3 Hotel Software

Method 2: URL/Domain Analysis (High Confidence, Low Cost)

Many providers host the booking engine on their own domain or a specific subdomain.

Action:

Obtain the URL of the main website homepage (e.g., www.mainattraction.com).

Obtain the URL of the booking page.

Compare the hostnames. If the booking page hostname is different, especially if it contains a recognizable name, it's the provider.

Maintain a dictionary of known booking engine domains (retailint-tickets.com, p3hotels.com, etc.) to match against.

Example (Blarney Castle):

Booking URL: https://blarneycastle.retailint-tickets.com/Home

The domain retailint-tickets.com is a direct identifier.

Result: Retail Integration

Method 3: Source Code Fingerprinting (Medium/High Confidence, Medium Cost)

If the above methods fail, scan the raw HTML for technology- and brand-specific "fingerprints." This requires building a library of known patterns.

Action:

Fetch the HTML content.

Scan the code for the following patterns:

A) Branded Code Artifacts:

File Paths & Names: Look for provider names in CSS, JS, or image paths.

Example: <script src="/ibe/js/p3core.js"></script> -> P3

Example: <link ... href=".../icons/p3/icon-favicon.png"> -> P3

HTML Comments & IDs: Look for unique IDs or comments left by developers.

Example: <!-- END HOTEL INFO BUTTONS P3B --> -> P3

Example (historical): <body id="bestUnionBody"> -> Vivaticket (formerly Best Union)

B) Technology Stack Fingerprints: Identify the underlying framework, which can narrow down the potential providers.

Microsoft ASP.NET Web Forms (Enterprise-level systems):

Form Tag: <form id="aspnetForm" ...>

Hidden Field: <input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" ...>

Script Files: URLs containing WebResource.axd or ScriptResource.axd

Element IDs: IDs starting with patterns like ctl00$

Inference: Often used by providers like Vivaticket for large venues.

Modern JavaScript Frameworks (Angular, React, Vue):

Angular: Look for the <app-root></app-root> element in the <body>.

Inference: Used by providers like Retail Integration.

React: Look for <div id="root"></div> and script names with react or webpack.

Vue.js: Look for <div id="app"></div> and vue.js in script tags.

Method 4: Network Request Analysis (Highest Confidence, High Cost - Advanced)

This is an advanced technique for definitive identification when others fail. It requires a headless browser (e.g., Puppeteer, Selenium) to simulate user interaction.

Action:

Load the booking page in a headless browser.

Monitor network traffic (XHR/Fetch requests).

When a user would interact with the page (e.g., changing a date), capture the API endpoint URLs that the page calls to get data.

These API endpoint domains will almost always belong to the booking system provider, not the hotel.

Example: A request to api.somebookingengine.com/getAvailability is a definitive identifier.

Proposed Implementation Workflow

Input: Homepage URL and Booking Page URL.

Step 1 (URL Check): Compare booking URL hostname to homepage. Check against a known list of provider domains. If match, return provider.

Step 2 (Footer Check): Fetch booking page HTML. Parse the footer for keywords. If match, return provider.

Step 3 (Fingerprint Scan): Scan the full HTML for the library of fingerprints (both branded and technology-based). If a high-confidence fingerprint is matched, return provider.

Step 4 (Log & Report): If no match is found, log the URL as "Unknown" for manual review. This helps build out the fingerprint library over time.

(Optional - Deep Scan): Implement Method 4 (Network Analysis) as a secondary, on-demand process for difficult cases.

By structuring the identification logic in this waterfall manner, you create a system that is fast and efficient for the majority of cases while providing deeper analysis for the more obscured ones.
